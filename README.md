After finishing my studies on civil engineering, I decided to follow my passion about science,
therefore continued my higher education with subject of Elementary Particles and Field theory in Physics Master’s program.
I finished my degree by “Construction of Gamma ray and Muon particle detector with PIN photodiode” thesis.
By getting know about computational physics and learning Python programming language,
I was touched with Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence methods and algorithms.
I’m following to have opportunities to continue my education as Ph. D. student on Quantum machine learning and  Quantum computation.
I have high social relations and teamwork spirit, also problem solver and goal oriented personality,
with teaching  experience at university with high interest in research and executive projects.
